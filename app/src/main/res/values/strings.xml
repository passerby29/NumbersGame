        Rules of the game: you will have three figures in front of you,
        two from below and one from above, two of them will have numbers.
        It is necessary that the sum of the numbers from the two lower figures be equal
        to the number in the upper figure, to do this, you need to insert the missing number.
        \n\nExample: the number 7 is in the upper circle, in one from the lower question mark,
        and in the other the number 4. So in place of the question mark should
        be the number 3 because 3 + 4 = 7
